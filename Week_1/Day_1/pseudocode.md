# Pseudocode

- formalizing problem descriptions
- breaking problems down into smaller parts
- using pseudocode to design solutions before translating them into JavaScript

## Pseudocode Steps

1 - Understand the problem

    - condider input(s)
    - output(s)

2 - Write out problem step by step in words.

    eg. - Loop from 100 to 200:
        - Let num = the current step in the loop
        - If num % 3 is equal to 0 and num %   4 is equal to 0: Print "LoopyLighthouse"
        - Else if num % 3 is equal to 0: Print "Loopy"
        - Else if num % 4 is equal to 0: Print "Lighthouse"
        - Otherwise Print num
        - End if
        - End loop

3 - Translate to JS

4 - Refactor code
